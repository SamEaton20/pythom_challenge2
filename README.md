For both data sets, I was able to get all the correct data for the Module
    For PyBank found the total months, the average of the profits, the month with the greatest increase and the month with the greatest decrease. 
    for PyPoll found the total votes, the candidates votes (percent and number), and the winner.
        To get the codes to run I had to change the directory with cd on either PyBank or PyPoll. 
I did have to help from my TA and Teacher in getting my csv files correct. 
Also, I used ChatGPT to help clean up my code.
